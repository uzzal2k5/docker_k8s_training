#### Docker Clustering with Swarm 

##### Requirements
*   A general idea of virtualization or container software
*   Familiarity with Linux and the command line
*   A general understanding of software installation, packaging, dependencies, etc.

##### Overview
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the building, shipping and running of software applications inside containers. Multi-container Docker applications can be further defined using Compose.

Swarm is a tool that controls a cluster of Docker hosts and exposes them as a single "virtual" host. By pooling together numerous Docker engines, Swarm allows IT operations teams to transparently scale up their software deployment to many hosts.

In this instructor-led, live training, participants start with an overview of software containerization concepts, then carry out live exercises to put into practice the concepts learned.


By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

*   Deploy Docker hosts across multiple machines using Compose and Swarm.
*   Manage a Swarm cluster in a live lab environment.
*   Secure and troubleshoot Docker hosts within their Swarm cluster


##### Audience

*   Software developers
*   System administrator
*   IT managers and operations teams

##### Format of the course

*   Part lecture, part discussion, exercises and heavy hands-on practice
